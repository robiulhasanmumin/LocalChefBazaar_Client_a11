## Description
**Local Chef Bazaar** is a modern online platform that connects home cooks with people looking for fresh, homemade food. Customers can explore daily menus, check a chef’s availability, place orders, make secure payments, and track their orders in real time.
For home cooks, it provides an easy way to earn money from their kitchen without needing a physical restaurant. For customers, it offers access to healthy, affordable, homemade meals prepared by local chefs.
The platform includes features like user registration, food ordering, real-time order tracking, ratings and reviews, and role-based access control. LocalChefBazaar will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
